Introducing A NEW T - TYPE 
that accepts any data types o/

It's like a global - declared T type. 
It gets and returns the same type used in the parameter.

so instead of int as a parameter, 
it will work with floats, chars, and even classes!


SYNTAX:

template <typename 'KEYWORD'>

(same principle as defining/declaring a variable at the beginning of the program)
