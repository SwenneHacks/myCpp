Span

Turn-in directory : ex01/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Span.{h, hpp}, Span.cpp
Forbidden functions : None

# Develop a Span class that can store a maximum of N integers. 
N is an unsigned int variable and will be the only parameter 
passed to the constructor.

This class will have a member function to add a 
single number to the Span:
# addNumber() 
It will be used in order to fill it. Any attempt to add a new element 
if there are already N elements stored should throw an exception.

Next, implement two member functions: 
# shortestSpan() and longestSpan()
They will respectively find out the shortest span or 
the longest span (or distance, if you prefer) between 
all the numbers stored, and return it. If there are no numbers stored,
 or only one, no span can be found. Thus, throw an exception.

Of course, you will write your own tests and they will be way more 
thorough than the ones below. 
# Test your Span at least with a minimum of 10,000 numbers. 
More would be even better. Last but not least, it would be wonderful
to fill your Span using a range of iterators.

Making thousands calls to addNumber() is so annoying. 
# Implement a member function to add many numbers to your Span in one call.
If you donâ€™t have a clue, study the Containers. Some member
functions take a range of iterators in order to add a sequence of
elements to the container.
