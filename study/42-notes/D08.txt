STL: Standard Template Library  (stopped at 7:00)

contains a few important things:

CONTAINERS - generic templated containers (able to contain anything and are very very good implementation of most container types you might want to use as a developer).

ALGORITHMS - allowing to make operations on a collection, which can be a standard container on STL or even a container you made yourself.

OPERATIONS - functions existent in containers to manipulate specific data (lists/vectors/deques)

ITERATORS - basically it's the STL container equivalent of pointers (not exactly the same), you gotta instantiate, syntax bah, use dots to call.

MAP - it's a cpp version of a hash table. dictionary associate of ARRAY (the thing of a billion names) but we don't have to use strings as keys for our values.

VECTORS - basically a smart array that contains whatever we need and we can use it in many ways, you can declare it and give a value by default.
