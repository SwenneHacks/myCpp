1.
NEW and DELETE
Memory Management

malloc objects in classes won't work (because it won't call the constructors/destructors).

STACK       	 HEAP

main		dynamic
(static)			mem

when pointing/allocating to heap make sure to use new array[] and then delete[] at the end of function().


2.
REFERENCES

BALLS BALLS BAAAAALLLSSSSS. quoted by Kanye West

HOW TO DESCRIBE IT:
upgrader to pointer (simpler) = alias to an existing variable, 
or better said: it's a pointer that is constant and always unreferenced and never void.

Cant reference to nothing. You gotta declare/assign it to a var.


Oh damnnnn he is talking about weapons now. Returning references - WTF.



3.
INPUT/OUTPUT FILE-STREAM

(We have already learned how to handle standard in/output + error).
Now we can interact with files.

ifstream (input file-stream) ofstream (output)

Extra ones:
std::sstream
std::istringstream
std::ostringstream
